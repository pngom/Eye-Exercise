This project is an assignment that I completed to fulfill the requirements of the [MIT Professional Certificate in Coding using MERN.](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding?u)  

The assignment was about creating two eyes and making them follow the movement of the mouse synchronously.

## Repository File Structure
There are three files required to run the Eyes exercise. All three files are listed in this repository: 

* **[index.html](https://github.com/pngom/Eye-Exercise/blob/main/index.html)**
* **[eye.js](https://github.com/pngom/Eye-Exercise/blob/main/eyes.js)**
* **[styles.css](https://github.com/pngom/Eye-Exercise/blob/main/styles.css)**


## How to run the Eye exercise
It is important to keep the same file structure when dowloading the files to run the Eye exercise on your local computer. The html, javascript (.js) and styles (.css) files should be kept in the same directory. Note that both the styles and javascript files are called by the html file. Therefore the program will not run if the files are renamed unless the file references are updated accordingly. 

1. Download the index.html, eye.js and styles.css to the same directory on your computer
2. Open an Internet browser window (e.g. using Google Chrome) and drag and drop the index.html onto the page
3. The two eyes are displayed on the page. Move your mouse and the eyes will follow it's movement
    

## Roadmap of future improvements
- When mouse is placed between the two eyes, make both eye balls move toward the mouse as real people's eye balls would do
